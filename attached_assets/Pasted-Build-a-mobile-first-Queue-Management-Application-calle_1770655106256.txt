Build a mobile-first "Queue Management Application" called SmartQ for patients visiting clinics.
Tech Stack: React (Vite), Tailwind CSS, Lucide React (Icons), Framer Motion (for smooth animations), and React Router.

### 1. DESIGN SYSTEM & VIBE
* **Theme:** Medical, Trustworthy, Clean.
* **Colors:** Primary Teal (#0F766E), Secondary Blue-Grey, Alert Orange (for "Leave Now"), Red (for Emergency).
* **Layout:** Mobile-first layout (max-width 480px centered on screen for desktop view to simulate a phone).
* **Typography:** Sans-serif, highly readable large numbers.

### 2. DATA STRUCTURE (MOCK DATA)
Create a `data.js` file with mock data:
* **Clinics:** Array of objects {id, name, type (Dentist/General), address, avgWaitTimePerPatient: 10, currentQueueLength: 12, lat, lng}.
* **Doctors:** Linked to clinics.
* **User:** {name, location, currentTransportMode: 'car'}.

### 3. CORE PAGES & FEATURES

#### Page A: Onboarding & Home
* **Header:** "Good Morning, Rahul". Location pin.
* **Search Bar:** "Search for clinics...".
* **Categories:** Chips for [All, Dentist, Skin, General, Labs].
* **Clinic List:** Cards showing:
    * Clinic Name & Doctor Name.
    * **Live Badge:** If queue < 5, show Green "Fast Moving". If queue > 10, show Red "High Wait".
    * **Stats:** "2.5km away" • "12 People waiting".

#### Page B: Clinic Detail & Booking
* Show Doctor info and "Today's Status" (e.g., "Dr. Sharma is In Cabin").
* **Booking Form:**
    * **Select Transport:** [Car (20 mins)] [Bike (15 mins)] [Walk (40 mins)]. *Hardcode these travel times for the demo.*
    * **Toggle:** "Emergency Booking" (Turns button Red).
    * **Action:** "Join Queue" button.

#### Page C: The "Active Token" Screen (CRITICAL PAGE)
* This is the post-booking screen.
* **Visuals:**
    * Big Card at top: "Your Token: #23".
    * "Currently Serving: #12".
    * **Progress Bar:** A visual bar filling up as the "Serving" number gets closer to "User Token".
* **The Smart Logic Calculation:**
    * `Total Wait Time` = (YourToken - ServingToken) * AvgWaitTime.
    * `Time to Leave` = Total Wait Time - Travel Time - 10min Buffer.
* **Dynamic UI State:**
    * **State 1 (Relax):** If Time to Leave > 15 mins, show Blue UI: "Relax at home."
    * **State 2 (Alert):** If Time to Leave <= 15 mins, show Orange UI: "Leave Now! Start Driving."
* **Buttons:** "I'm on my way", "Snooze (Push me back 2 spots)", "Cancel".

### 4. FUNCTIONALITY REQUIREMENTS
* Use `useState` to simulate the "Currently Serving" number moving. Make it increment automatically every 5 seconds so I can see the progress bar move.
* Use `framer-motion` to animate the progress bar and number changes.
* Ensure the "Travel Time" selected in the booking phase updates the logic on the Active Token page.
